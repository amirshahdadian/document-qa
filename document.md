## Problem Statement

International students in Italy often face significant challenges when navigating bureaucratic documents such as university announcements (*bandi*), regulations, and contracts. These documents are typically written in formal, legal, or academic language, which can be difficult to comprehend even for native speakers. For non-native speakers, the language barrier further complicates understanding, especially when technical terms, legal jargon, and domain-specific vocabulary are involved.

The complexity of these documents is compounded by their intricate structure and the critical information they contain, such as eligibility criteria, deadlines, and procedural requirements. Missing or misinterpreting this information can lead to missed opportunities, administrative delays, or non-compliance with regulations.

Existing solutions, such as manual translation services, generic search engines, or static FAQs, are often inadequate. They fail to provide context-aware, accurate, and multilingual support tailored to the specific needs of students. Moreover, these solutions lack the ability to reference the original document, leaving users uncertain about the reliability of the information provided.

There is a clear need for an intelligent, multilingual system that can process these documents, extract relevant information, and provide accurate, cited answers in a user-friendly manner. Addressing this gap is essential to empower international students and ensure equitable access to academic and administrative resources. Fulfilling this need directly addresses the requirements of key stakeholders, including students seeking clarity and university administrators aiming for greater efficiency.
